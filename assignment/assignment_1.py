# Write a program that accepts employee data such as name, date of birth,
# salary and number of years they worked at the company.
# The program should accept three employee data and store it in a dictionary.
# Give 5% bonus for employees who served for five or more years.
# Finally, print this information like:
#
# Name		Date of birth		Experience	   Salary 	New Salary
# Biniam	02.02.1988			    5           1000		1050
# Kidu		06.08.1991			    2           2000		2000
# Hareg		01.01.1993			    1           1500		1500

# Hints
# 1. Use for loop to accept 3 employee data (loop)
# 2. Create a dictionary and store each employees data (dictionary in a list)
# 3. Iterate/loop over all employee dictionary and calculate bonus based on
#    number of experience and store the new salary (loop and if-statement)
# 4. Iterate over all employees and print the result as shown above. (loop)
# 5. Use functions to organize your code (function)

# Example of functions
# # Functions accept input -> process -> give output
# def accept_student_data():
#     # This function accepts student data
#
# def store_student_data(student):
#     # This function stores student data
#
# def calculate_grade(student) -> float:
#     # This function calculates grade
#
# def print_student_data(student) -> void:
#     # Prints student data
#
# The main function will call all functions one by one
# def main():
# 	accept_student_data() -> store_student_data()
# 	calculate_grade()
#   print_student_data()
